You will find the source code of my Web-Pwn-Bash-Misc-Foren tasks and the Dockerfiles for Securinets Educational CTF, it was beginner friendly CTF that lasted for 3 days with daily live streams . I participated by creating these tasks and managing the infrastructure of the CTF .

The commands to run each task locally or in a production server are also included.
